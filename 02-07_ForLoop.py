'''
Carl Friedrich Gauss' solution to add the totals of numbers between 0-100
'''
# total = 0
# for num in range(101):
#     total = total + num
# print(total)
'''
The above for loop solves this problem.
How Gauss solved it was to add the pairs of numbers that add up to 100:
01+99...
02+98...
49+51
= 5000
+50
=5050
